# CONTRIBUTING

This project was generated by the [dash-component-boilerplate](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate) it contains the minimal set of code required to create your own custom Dash component.

The following sources helped me in building it:
+ https://github.com/lilyminium/dash-ngl - Complex dash NGL component
+ https://github.com/McMenemy/viztein - Light React wrapper around [NGL](https://github.com/arose/ngl)
+ https://github.com/Downchuck/react-ngl-demo - React SPA that uses NGL and can load/display a PDB
+ https://github.com/ucg8j/awesome-dash - Curated list of awesome Dash (plotly) resources
